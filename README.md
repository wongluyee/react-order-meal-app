# react-order-meal-app
An app for ordering meal

Learning React by following a tutorial and built this app.

## New things I learned when building this app
1. usePortal: Use the modal component wherever I want but render the actual HTML elements in a specific place in the DOM tree.
2. useContext: Pass cart context data through multiple levels.
3. useReducer: Manage state. Check whether a meal is already part of the cart or not.
4. useRef: Persist the amount values between renders.
5. Forward Refs: useRef on custom component.
6. useEffect: animation of Add button (add a bump CSS class) appears depending on the change of items in cart
